# METHODOLOGY
The methodology employed in this study aims to provide a
sophisticated simulation of nanobiosensor responses to timedependent biomarker concentration profiles. The simulation
involves precise parameter definition, nanobiosensor configuration, and a systematic approach to capturing the dynamic
nature of biomarker interactions.
A. Temporal Dynamics Modeling
1) Temporal Grid Definition: To precisely capture the temporal dynamics of biomarker concentration, a finely discretized
temporal grid is established. The number of time points
(numPoints) is set to 100 to ensure a detailed representation
of the dynamic biomarker environment.
time = linspace(0, 10, numPoints) (1)
2) Biomarker Concentration Profile: The biomarker concentration profile (biomarkerConcentrationProfile) is modeled as a sinusoidal function. This choice provides a dynamic
and realistic representation of biomarker fluctuations over
time, incorporating both amplitude and frequency variations.
biomarkerConcentrationProfile = sin(time) × 50 + 50 (2)
B. Nanobiosensor Configuration
1) Nanobiosensor Characteristics: The nanobiosensor
characteristics are meticulously defined to ensure a comprehensive simulation. Two distinct types of nanobiosensors are
considered: affinity and catalytic. Each type is constructed with
